# Adaptive-mixture-categorization (AMC)-based g-computation
Adaptive-mixture-categorization (AMC)-based g-computation approach combines g-computation with an optimal categorization search using the F statistic. It reduces variance within each category and retains the variance between categories to build more powerful predictors for mixture analysis.
